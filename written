1.  Exercise 1.8:
	a.  Setting the value of a timer should be privileged.
	b.  
	c.
	d.
	e.  Turning off interrupts should be privileged.
	f.
	g.  Switching from user mode to kernal mode should be privileged.
	h.

2.  Exercise 2.13:
	1.  Message queue
	2.  system call
	3.  Shared memory

3.  Exercise 2.21:
	The main advantage of the microkernal approach to system design is
	increased security.  Only a minimal set of functionality runs in
	kernal mode (privileged).  This means that the number of processes
	with access to the hardware is smaller.  A smaller amount of code
	running in kernal mode means there will be fewer bugs in kernal
	mode.**********************************************

	User programs and system services communicate with each other through
	message passing facilitated by the microkernal.  They never interact
	directly.

	The main disadvantage of the microkernal approach is performance.
	Many system programs that would run in kernal mode in a monolithic
	operating system run in user mode in a microkernal operating system.
	Those system programs then have to communicate with the kernal
	through message passing rather than directly, which is slower.

4.  Exercise 2.25:
	************************************************
	The host operating system must be able to do everything that the
	guest operating system can do, meaning that the guest operating
	system can't expect privileges that the host operating system is
	unable to deliver.

5.  Exercise 2.26:
	

6.	No, a bug in a child process created by calling fork cannot damage
	the parent process.  The child process will have its own address
	space, and the operating system takes great care to ensure that
	no process can access another processes' memory space.

7.  

8.	The operating systems presents an interface between the hardware
	and the user.  Windowing systems are an integral part of the user
	experience in many cases, and should therefore be considered part
	of the operating system.  In addition, the operating system is
	responsible for allocating resources, including I/O resources such
	as the monitor.
